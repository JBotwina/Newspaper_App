# Newspaper_App

This web application is written in Django and Bootstrap. It allows logged in users to post articles and edit the articles that they posted.

## Skills that I learned:

1. Model-view-controller software design pattern in Django. Specifically, how to route pages to eachother.
2. Create, read, update, delete functionality.
3. Template Inheritance, HTML and CSS
4. Django's ORM management. Specifically, how to set fields to models and set up many-to-one relationships in class-based views.

## Highlight
The most interesting apect of this project was how to ensure that only the users that created the articles can edit them afterward, where I
utilized Django's mixins. 

## Next steps
I plan to allow users to add comments to the articles. Currently, this can only be done through the admin page.
